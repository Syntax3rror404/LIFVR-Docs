# Lumina Interaction Framework VR (LIFVR) Documentation

All questions about configuring grabable and interactible objects have a look here: [Grabbing and Interactions with objects](/interactions.md).
There is explained how to setup grabable objects, fixed grab poses and animation types, loose grabbing, index/middle grab, surface animations and grab circle with modes and much more.

## 3. VR Physics Hands

In this section we will give an overview how the physics hand work in LIFVR and how to change the hand mesh and default animations to custom ones.

### 3.0 Overview of VR Physics Hands

#### **Hand Classes Hierarchy**
---

The base parent class of all hands ios the VR_Hands class (BP_VR_Hands). This hand class does physical grabbing but has no physical connection to the character. **This class is not intended to be used with the BP_HexaCharacter!**.

How the hands work: pd switch, strength switch, collisions,
- switching hand poses: function explenation
